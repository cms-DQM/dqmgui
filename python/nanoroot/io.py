# Finally, some code for XrootD support. This is not really necessary to read (local)
# ROOT files, but this is why we do asyncio in the first place. This should not be
# used directly, without a layer of caching between us and XrootD. Such a cache is 
# *not* provided here. There is minimal caching for small reads, which is enough to
# read TTrees efficiently.
# https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/blob/master/src/XrdClient/README_params
# Note that XrootD client *can* read local files (just use a local path as URL), but
# it is much slower then mmap'ing.

# XRootD IO, using pyxrootd. IO latency with xrootd is not as bad as one could 
# think, it takes a few 100ms to open a remote file and a few ten's of ms to
# perform a random read. This is comparable to a normal filesystem on spinning 
# disks and faster than CEPH or mounted EOS (EOS xrootd is maybe 10x faster
# then xrootd from GRID, and slightly faster than mounted EOS, which is faster
# than CEPH standard volumes).
# Throughput can be over 100MBytes/s.

# PyXrootD uses threads and callbacks.
# We use this interface and translate it into asyncio coroutines.
