    """
    Protocol buffers is binary serialization format from Google. Python library for deserializing protobuf 
    encoded messages exist, however, it doesn't support partial reads - if we want to get just a single 
    histogram out, we have to read and deserialize the entire file. This is an implementation of protocol 
    buffers format deserializer with limited functionality as we only need to deserialize fields used in our 
    messages. To see the supported message format, please have a look at ROOTFilePB.proto. This deserializer 
    supports reading any number of histograms from any location in the file without reading/deserializing 
    anything else.

    In the main scope of the message there is only one repeated Histo field. Repeated fields are like lists
    that can have 0 to infinitely many elements. Histo message contains 4 required fields that hold data
    and metadata about the ME.

    Bellow I will discuss the implemented parts of the format. For a complete format specification please 
    have a look here: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding

    Data Formats:

    Full format specifies more data formats but we'll be using only two: variants and length-delimited values.

    Variant is a variable length number. For more info on how to deserialize it please look at the doc string
    of read_variant_value() function.

    Length-delimited value is an arbitrary length blob. For more information on how to deserialize it please 
    look at the doc string of read_length_delimited_value() function.

    Wire type reveals us the type of the value and tells us how to read it. Continue reading the Message 
    format section for more details.

    Message format:

    Messages are stored in key value pairs. Key is always of variant type. 3 least significant bits of this
    variant encode the wire type and remaining preceding bits encode the field number of the following value.
    For more information on how to extract wire type and field number from a variant please look at the doc
    string of read_field_number_and_wire_type() method.

    Every odd numbered element (1, 3, 5, ...) in the main message, as well as in every embedded message, is 
    a variant that splits into wire type and field number - a key. 
    Every even numbered element in the main message, as well as in every embedded message, is a value that we 
    read differently based on wire type.

    Wire type tells us the length of the value and instructions on how to read it. 
    Field number is just a number that was assigned to every field in the message so we could identify what
    field we have just deserialized. You can see what field corresponds to what field number in 
    ROOTFilePB.proto file.

    Since we only have a few data types in this implementation, we only care about two wire types: 
    0 - variant
    2 - Length-delimited value

    Embedded message, string and bytes will use wire type 2 and uint32 will use variant.

    Backwards compatibility:

    Protobuf format ensures that updated messages can be read with old serializers provided no breaking
    changes occur. All fields that we don't know about are just skipped. 

    Partial reading:

    The crux of this code is to be able to read only one histogram without having to read and deserialize 
    the entire file.

    read_histo_message() function does just that. Give it a buffer that is seeked to the correct position
    and a size of the message and it will return only one histo message without reading more bytes than
    required.

        Variants are variable length integers. Their wire type is 0.
        We read one byte at a time and check the most significant bit (msb) of each byte.
        If msb is 1, this is not the last byte of an integer.
        If msb is 0, this is the last byte of an integer (we still include it).

        Msb is just to tell us if there are more bytes to come or not. When decoding we drop it!!!

        Variants store numbers with the least significant group first, so when decoding, 
        groups of 7 bits have to be combined in a reversed order.

        Example:
        We know that the following message has a wire_type of 0 (it's a variant) and we want to decode it:

        1010 1100 0000 0010

        As you can see, msb of the first byte (8 bits) is 1, so we read the next byte too.
        Msb of the second byte is 0 meaning that it's the final byte we need to read.
        Now we drop both msbs:

        010 1100 000 0010

        And combine the groups in reverse order:

        000 0010 010 1100

        This is the binary representation of the decoded number:

        0000 0001 0010 1100
